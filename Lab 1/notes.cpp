MALLOC
 In a array;
 Pointer = (*)
 
 sizeof (*int())

The statement will allocate 40or20 bytes and the pointer ptr holds the adress of the first byte
in the allocated memory.

About ReAlloc : This is used to resize the size of the memory block which is already alllocated by malloc.
Example - int astric pr = int astric malloc 5*sizeof 

ptr = reallloc (* 
ptr, 10 *sizeofint);
